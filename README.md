It was created as part of the DT Fellowship Simulation Assignment, focusing on orchestrating conversion funnels, structuring CRMs, reducing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), and building sustainable systems for MSMEs.

The business model aims to help small silver and gold jewelry retailers compete effectively with corporate showrooms by using transparent pricing, CRM-based funnel logic, and modern business analysis tools.
